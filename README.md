# Deep Learning

# Environment
* I am using a GPU with ML/AI with Cuda cores enabled.
* venv's are used. 
* I've compiled DLIB manually with Cuda enabled & AVX(Facial recognition)
* PyTorch & FastAI are Cuda enabled
* Environment = Jupyter-lab & CLI

* Code messages were **copied**. See the link above.
1. = All messages are logged (default behavior)
2. = INFO messages are not printed
3. = INFO and WARNING messages are not printed
4. = INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages are not printed
